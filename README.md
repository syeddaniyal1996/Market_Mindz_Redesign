# 📌 Recommendations
Double Down on High-Performing Campaigns

Replicate strategies from Campaign 6 and Campaign 5, as they drive the most revenue.

Reassess or retire Campaign 2 since ROI is minimal.

# Product Strategy
Juices and Meat are cash cows → bundle them with lower-performing categories (e.g., Fruits or Sweets) to increase basket size.

Introduce targeted promotions for underperforming categories (like Sweets and Fruits).

# Customer Segmentation
Focus marketing on middle-aged, high-income, married customers with no kids — they show the strongest purchasing power.

Create special campaigns for lower-income groups to expand market reach.

# Channel Optimization
Invest more in Store and Web platforms since they drive most purchases.

Consider optimizing Catalog/Deals or shifting resources away if ROI doesn’t improve.

# Campaign Personalization
Use income-based targeting (premium campaigns for >$60K income segment).

Design family-focused campaigns for smaller segments with kids/teens at home.

# Next Steps for Deeper Insights
Conduct RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to refine loyalty segmentation.

Explore cross-sell patterns (e.g., what products are often bought together with Juices).

Track customer lifetime value (CLV) to prioritize high-value groups.
